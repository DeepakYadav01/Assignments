     <h1>Recipes - World's Best Scrambled Eggs</h1>
     <p> I adapted this recipe from a book called Sydney Food by Bill Grainger.
          Ever since tasting these eggs on my 1st visit to Bill's restaurant in Kings Cross, Sydney, I have been after the recipe. I have since transformed it into what I really believe are the best scrambled eggs I have ever tasted.
    </p>
    <p>
            This recipe is what I call a very special breakfast; just look at the ingredients to see why. It has to be tasted to be believed.
    </p>
     <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <p>
            The following ingredients make one serving:
     </p>
     <ul>
         <li>
                2 eggs
         </li>
         <li>
                1 tablespoon of butter (10g)
         </li>
         <li>
                1/3 cup of cream (2 3/4 fl ounces)
         </li>
         <li>
                A pinch of salt
        </li>
        <li>
                Freshly milled black pepper
        </li>
        <li>
                3 fresh chives (chopped)
        </li>
     </ul>

     <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                    Whisk eggs, cream, and salt in a bowl.            </li>
            <li>
                    Melt the butter in a non-stick pan over a high heat (taking care not to burn the butter).

            </li>
            <li>
                    Pour egg mixture into pan and wait until it starts setting around the edge of the pan (around 20 seconds).

            </li>
            <li>
                    Using a wooden spatula, bring the mixture into the center as if it were an omelet, and let it cook for another 20 seconds.

            </li>
            <li>
                    Fold contents in again, leave for 20 seconds, and repeat until the eggs are only just done.

            </li>
            <li>
                    Grind a light sprinkling of freshly milled pepper over the eggs and blend in some chopped fresh chives.


            </li>

        </ol>
       <p>You should only make a maximum of two servings per frying pan.</p>
